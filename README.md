# Coronavirus (COVID-19) Data Generated Videos

This is a demo to showcase using a data source to generate videos using the [Shotstack API](https://shotstack.io/docs/api/index.html).

A NodeJS script loops through a data set of Coronavirus (Covid-19) global pandemic cases and deaths 
sourced from [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data) and generates a 
video for a selected country.

## Requirements

This project was developed using Node v10.15.3 and NPM 6.4.1.

### API Key
To run the project you will need a Shotstack API key. If you do not have a key you can sign up via 
the [Shotstack website](https://shotstack.io/).

Once you have a key, copy the `.env.dist` file and name it `.env`. Then add your staging API key next to 
the `SHOTSTACK_KEY=` parameter.

Your `.env` file should look something like:

```
SHOTSTACK_ENDPOINT=https://api.shotstack.io/stage
SHOTSTACK_KEY=KnYTD1jak82B83hwvL8kT5jlT66MMVqI2zE4dPPs
```

## Installation

Install dependencies using the following: 

```
npm install
```

---

## Usage

### Fetch/Update Data

Fetch the latest Coronavirus dataset:

```
npm run dataset
```

A CSV file `full_data.csv` is downloaded and saved in the project root directory.

### List Countries

Display the list of countries available in the CSV file:

```
npm run list
```

### Generate Video

Run the following command with the country you wish to generate a video for:

```
npm run generate -- --country [Country]
```

Replace [Country] with the country you want to generate a video for, i.e.

```
npm run generate -- --country 'Australia'
```

Note: the country value is case sensitive and must be entered exactly as it is stored in
the `Location` column in the CSV file. Use the `npm run list` command to see a list of 
countries.

The edit request will be sent to the Shotstack API to be queued for rendering. After approximately 
20 seconds the video will be ready and the URL will be output to the terminal.
